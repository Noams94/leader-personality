    "title": "The Research",
    "subtitle": "A Lexical Approach to Leadership Personality",
    "phdBadge": "PhD Research",
    "whyTitle": "Why a Lexical Approach?",
    "whyDesc": "Most leadership research starts with theory — asking participants to rate leaders on pre-defined scales. The lexical approach goes the other way: it starts with natural language. By asking followers to describe their leaders in their own words, we capture the personality dimensions that actually matter to people, not just the ones researchers assumed would matter.",
    "insightBoxTitle": "The Core Insight",
    "insightBoxText": "If you want to know what personality dimensions matter in a leader, don't ask researchers — ask followers. The adjectives people naturally reach for when describing their leaders encode centuries of accumulated social knowledge about what leadership actually is.",
    "bigFiveTitle": "Why Not the Big Five?",
    "bigFiveDesc": "The Big Five personality framework (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) was derived from descriptions of people in general. But leaders are not 'people in general.' When followers describe their leaders, two factors emerge that the Big Five simply cannot capture:",
    "bigFiveFactor1": "Supportiveness — a warm, nurturing quality that followers cite as crucial but that Big Five measures as generic Agreeableness",
    "bigFiveFactor2": "Weakness — a factor describing ineffective, passive, or cowardly leaders, absent from all standard frameworks",
    "studyTitle": "Study Design",
    "study2Badge": "Study 2",
    "study2Title": "Study 2: Item Derivation",
    "study2Desc": "Hebrew-speaking followers generated free descriptions of leaders they had personally known. These descriptions were analyzed, reduced to a list of personality adjectives, and factor-analyzed to reveal the five-factor structure.",
    "study4Badge": "Study 4",
    "study4Title": "Study 4: Cross-Sector Validation",
    "study4Desc": "The factor structure was validated across three organizational contexts — Business, Military, and Religious — confirming both the universality of the five factors and meaningful sector-specific differences in factor scores.",
